## My Portfolio

I was inspired to use transition to using Gatsby for my portfolio after viewing [Brittany Chiang's site](https://brittanychiang.com/), and discovering that it is implemented using Gatsby as well.  Developing it with Gatsby has further developed my understanding of web development as well, and honed by ability to use React effectively.  It also introduced me to much of the web ecosystem, with frameworks such as Next.js also coming into play in my mind.  I had no experience with GraphQL prior to this project, so it has been a learning process.

There are many other portfolios that was have been inspired by in the making of this site thus far.  Examples include [Seb Kay's](https://sebkay.com/), [Josh Comeau's](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/), [Max Bock's](https://mxb.dev/), and [Cassie Evan's](https://www.cassie.codes/).  In the future, I plan to redesign it entirely once again, hopefully having a much more creative eye and ability to produce something extremely unique.  In the meantime while I improve my design abilities, I will be developing this current iteration.
